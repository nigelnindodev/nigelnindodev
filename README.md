Currently writing Typescript (NodeJS & Bun), Python & Go. 

Spent the most time writing Scala, and currently learning Rust in my spare time. 

Specialized in distributed systems, but talk to me about anything tech. Currently also working on [full stack development with HTMX.](https://github.com/nigelnindodev/BunHtmxFullStack)
